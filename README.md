# secureprogfinal

You are not required to use the GH Classroom repo, but you should create your own repo.  If you go this route, please make sure it is visible to neloe on Github (you can add me as a collaborator).

For the final project, you are to go back and evaluate a previous project you did in one of your earlier classes.  This project should exhibit some kind of input (user, file, etc) and will ideally be unit-testable (if it doesn't already have unit tests).

You (and your optional partner you signed up to work with) must identify areas of your code, coding standards, or use of development tools (VCS, IDEs, etc) that were insecure.  You must, at the very least:

Identify test coverage (if you have no tests, then this will start at 0%)
Apply static analysis tools appropriate to the language you chose
For the code portion of this assignment you must make at least 4 improvements to the code.  These could include:

Adding unit tests to improve test coverage
Addressing issues raised by your static analysis tool
Adding input validation to vulnerable inputs
Fixing memory leaks/memory errors, logical errors, etc
Improving design (refactoring into easily testable functions, etc)
Adding (working) automatic testing in GitHub
If you are working with a partner, both individuals must make commits.

You will be graded on your use of tools, including having good descriptive commits (see https://gist.github.com/turbo/efb8d57c145e00dc38907f9526b60f17Links to an external site. for some good rules).

You will be creating a writeup with the issues you identify that were not improved on in this portion of the assignment; make sure to keep screenshots or text dumps of output!

Note: The number of points on this assignment may change before the end of the semester as I put the grading rubric together.
